## Personal Learnings:
- This project requires a lot of CSS to style different pages. In the future I would take more time a head of time to find the similarities between the pages to make a template for similar designed pages.
- This project is mostly dynamic and let the user to change the content and images from the back end of the wordpress. 
- my main challenge was to understanding the template hierarchy
structure. Going through the process of putting files together I have got a better understand of the wordpress structure.
- This project wasn't originally designed to be responsive because of time constraints.
